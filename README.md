# Deer-Isle-Traders

This file contains two vanilla and one black market trader designed for and used by Noobs Only Deer Isle.

This repository contains:
1. The .dze file so you can export and include these traders in any format you prefer.
2. A .txt file that that includes trader object coordinates for your convenience. My server uses the Trader mod from Dr. Jones. Whichever trader mod you use, the coordinates will probably be helpful.
3. A .png showing the general coordinates of a building that will need to removed from your mapgroupos.xml.

Mods that went into this design include ArrakisTraderSigns, Trader by Dr. Jones, ZT Vending Machine, Advanced Banking, and MuchStuffPack. The .dze and .txt reference or use items from those mods but are not required by you.

This design does have one deleted building that you will need to remove from your mapgrouppos.xml - look for a land_barn_wood1 at or near coordinates 6192.00 / 2349.50 so that you do not have floating loot from a building that is no longer on the map.

Special thanks to the NoobsOnly server owner for allowing me to help with standing up our Deer Isle server from the beginning of the project. Feel free to edit, manipulate, think obsessively about this trader build, and/or use this build as you see fit. I do not give permission to repack or reupload this mod, if you do so you'll never receive updates.
